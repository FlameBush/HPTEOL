# HPTEOL

The recent events happen 20 years after the death of Voldemort(the dark lord). Harry Potter gets ill very badly and his daughter Vinnie finds a random paper sent from Nicholas Flamel to Dumbledore explaining how the Philosopher's stone is impossible to be destroyed only separated(the stone is a combination of 3 stones therefore the 3 stones themselves are impossible to be destroyed) Vinnie sees hope in that and tries to find them. There are 3 stones, red, black and white. There are 5 levels 3 of which are about finding the stones 1 forging the stone and the final one is a battle between Harry and Vinnie because during the Forging the stones corrupted themselves and Vinnie is forced to kill Harry who has already drank from The Elixir of Life which is extracted from the Philosopher's stone.

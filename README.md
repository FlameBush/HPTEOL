The recent events happen 20 years after the death of Voldemort(the dark lord). Hagrid gets ill very badly and Harry gets to a random paper sent from Nicholas Flamel to Dumbledore explaining how the Philosopher's stone is impossible to be destroyed only separated(the stone is a combination of 3 stones therefore the 3 stones themselves are impossible to be destroyed) Harry sees hope in that and tries to find them. There are 3 stones, red, black and white. There are 5 levels 3 of which are about finding the stones 1 forging the stone and the final one is a battle between Harry and Hagrid because during the Forging the stones corrupted themselves and harry is forced to kill Hagrid who already drank from The Elixir of Life which is extracted from the stones. .
